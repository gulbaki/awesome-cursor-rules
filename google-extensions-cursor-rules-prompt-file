1. **Project Structure & Organization**
   - Create a well-structured Chrome extension with the following typical files:
     - `manifest.json` for extension configuration.
     - `background.js` or `service_worker.js` for background tasks (depending on Manifest V2 or V3).
     - `content_script.js` for any script injecting or modifying web pages as needed.
     - `popup.html` and `popup.js` for the extension’s popup UI.
     - Optional additional scripts/modules in a folder structure that is logical and organized.
   - Use best practices for file organization and naming. 
   - Keep the codebase modular so that it is easy to maintain and extend.

2. **OpenAI Integration**
   - Show how to integrate the OpenAI API, including:
     - Properly handling API keys without exposing them in public repositories.
     - Configuring and making calls to the OpenAI API endpoint.
   - Provide clear, reusable functions/classes for making AI-related requests.
   - Handle responses gracefully and provide appropriate error handling.
   - Avoid storing the OpenAI API key in client-side code. If necessary, mention secure handling strategies (e.g., through a backend proxy or environment variables).

3. **Security & Permissions**
   - **Minimal Permissions**: Only request the Chrome extension permissions strictly required for the functionality (e.g., if you only need to modify a page’s DOM, do not request unnecessary permissions like reading browsing history).
   - Follow best practices to protect users from any security vulnerabilities. 
   - Avoid storing sensitive user data in plain text. 
   - If data is stored, use clear disclaimers or methods to protect user privacy.

4. **UI/UX and Styling**
   - Create a clean, user-friendly UI for the popup or extension pages.
   - Provide responsive and minimal design using HTML and CSS. 
   - Use standard Chrome extension UI patterns where applicable (popup, options page, etc.).
   - Make sure user interactions with AI functionalities are clear and intuitive.

5. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - Implement friendly error messages for users (e.g., if the API fails or the user is offline).
   - Log errors where appropriate, ensuring you do not accidentally log sensitive information.
   - Provide fallback scenarios (e.g., if the API call fails, show the user a message and possibly retry).

6. **Performance Considerations**
   - Keep the extension lightweight. Only load code necessary for each component.
   - Minimize background scripts and resource usage.
   - Optimize any repeated calls to the OpenAI API, using caching strategies if relevant (within reason, depending on the application’s needs).

7. **Comments & Documentation**
   - Write clear, concise comments explaining each major block of code.
   - Provide a brief README describing:
     - How to install and load the extension in Chrome.
     - How to configure the OpenAI API key (if needed).
     - Any special usage notes or disclaimers.

8. **Testing & Validation**
   - Ensure the extension runs successfully with no console errors when loaded as an “unpacked” extension in Chrome.
   - Provide simple tests or manual steps for the user to verify the extension’s primary functions.
   - Test edge cases (e.g., no OpenAI API key, invalid responses, slow internet, etc.).

9. **Legal & Ethical**
   - Include disclaimers about the AI usage and its potential limitations.
   - If user data is collected or processed, mention it in a privacy policy.
   - Comply with OpenAI’s usage policies and guidelines (e.g., content moderation if required).

10. **Implementation Steps & Requested Output**
    - **Implementation**: Start by scaffolding the extension (manifest, core files), then implement AI calls, UI, error handling, etc.
    - **Output**: Provide a ready-to-run code bundle or a step-by-step walkthrough, with clarity on how to install and test the extension in Chrome.
    - **Maintainability**: Write the code so that future developers (or the same developer in the future) can easily update the extension.
